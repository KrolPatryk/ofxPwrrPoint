# ofxPwrrPoint

replacement for slideshow deck. mostly replicates slideshow features (load images, movies, text). nice because you can integrate full OF apps directly into it.

features
 - images, videos, text
 - "scrollable image" - lets you embed giant pictures in slides and scroll through them with the mouse.
 - automatically resizes and repositions assets when screen size changed

To-do
 - preload assets
 - sound handling
 - one click export: set a flag and it will automatically copy all the assets into local dir, build the presentation as distributable app
 - wrap lambda functions for more customized slide actions/events
 - ofxCef -> full web browser for javascript demos? maybe this is overkill...
